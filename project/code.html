        <h4 class="section-title"> Why Water Matters?</h4>
        <p class="text">Did you know that the human body is approximately 60-70% water? In our busy daily routines, we often forget to stay hydrated, leading to fatigue, headaches, and a lack of focus. Proper hydration is the secret to glowing skin, high energy levels, and a healthy heart.Water matters because it's essential for all life, enabling bodily functions like nutrient transport, waste removal, and temperature regulation; supporting ecosystems, agriculture, and industry; and driving economies, while also being a critical resource for health, dignity, and climate resilience, despite facing global shortages and pollution threats. It's the medium for life's chemical processes and crucial for hygiene, food production, and overall societal well-being, making access to clean water a fundamental human right. </p>

        <h4 class="section-title ">The Science of H20 </h4>
        <p class="text">Water isn't just a drink; it's the life force flowing through your veins. Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body needs water to work correctly. When you are even 1% dehydrated, your brain fog increases and your physical performance drops.Water is essential for nearly every bodily function, acting as a transporter for nutrients and oxygen, a regulator of body temperature (through sweat), a lubricant for joints and tissues, and a key player in digestion, waste removal (kidneys/liver), and maintaining cell function by balancing electrolytes, protecting organs, and keeping skin moist and elastic, making it crucial for overall health and survival. </p>
