# 💧 Hydra Care Reminder App

Hydra Care is a simple web app that reminds you to drink water. It helps you stay healthy and hydrated while you work or study.

## ✨ Features

* **Set Your Time:** You can choose how many minutes you want between reminders.
* **Sound Alarm:** A loud alarm plays when it is time to drink water.
* **Stop with One Click:** The sound stops as soon as you click 'OK' on the alert.
* **Easy to Use:** It has a clean and simple blue design.

## 🛠️ How it was built

* **HTML**: For the page structure and the audio player.
* **CSS**: For the colors, buttons, and layout.
* **JavaScript**: For the timer and controlling the sound.

2.  Open the `app.html` file in your browser (like Chrome or Edge).
3.  Type the minutes in the box (Example: 30).
